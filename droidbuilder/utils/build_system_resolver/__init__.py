# This file will contain a factory function that detects the build system
# of a given package and returns the appropriate resolver instance.
#
# The factory will inspect the package's source code for files like:
# - CMakeLists.txt (for CMake)
# - configure.ac / configure.in (for Autotools)
# - meson.build (for Meson)
# - Configure (for OpenSSL)
#
# Based on the detected build system, it will return an instance of a
# concrete resolver class (e.g., CMakeResolver, AutotoolsResolver, etc.).
#
# This will allow the main builder to be completely decoupled from the
# specifics of each build system.
